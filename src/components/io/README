SUMMARY

    Linux I/O component

DESCRIPTION

    This network component enables PAPI-C to access the io
    statistics exported by the Linux kernel through the /proc
    pseudo-file system (file /proc/self/io).

    This component will dynamically create a native events table.

    Event names
    -------------------------
      "<ifname>.rchar",
      "<ifname>.wchar",
      "<ifname>.syscr",
      "<ifname>.syscw",
      "<ifname>.read_bytes",
      "<ifname>.write_bytes",
      "<ifname>.cancelled_write_bytes"

    By default the Linux kernel only updates the io statistics
    once every second (see the references listed in the "SEE ALSO"
    section for some problems you may come across and for how to
    change the default polling period).

    Note: The Linux network statistics are updated by code that
    resides in the file ?
